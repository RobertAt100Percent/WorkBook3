//this is a simple excrise because it basically shows us how to make and call functions. 
//since the functions only dislay ot the console its, 

//to declare a function in javaScript we simply need to type "function"
//after this we will name the function, then give it conditions (or not)
//finially we put code into a pair of curlly brackets that appear right after the parentheses
function favoriteThings() {
  //display to the console
    console.log("Craig's favorite things are");
    console.log("My favorite movie is Usual Suspects.");
    console.log("My favorite band is A Tribe Called Quest.");
  }
  
  //call the function
  favoriteThings();
  
  function whyImHere() {
    //we can start a new line in the console by using the \n
    console.log(
      `I really like the students and their attitudes \nand feel like I'm making a difference in their lives.`
    );
